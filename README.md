The project has three key parts:

1. **Initial Prompt Creation**:
    - Email, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn InMail prompts tailored to different business sizes (startups vs. large exporters).
    - Includes messaging strategy for follow-up emails.

2. **Prompt Improvement**:
    - Critique of an original vague prompt.
    - Redesigned prompt with defined audience, benefits, call to action, and tone.

3. **Testing Strategy**:
    - Proposed a simple method to evaluate the quality of generated messages.
    - Included metrics: Clarity, Persuasiveness, and Effectiveness.
    - Suggested peer reviews and optional A/B testing for real-world feedback.

## ðŸ“¬ Communication Channels

Prompts were developed for:
- **Email**
- **WhatsApp**
- **LinkedIn InMail**

Each tailored to business context and tone: friendly, professional, persuasive.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Approach

- **Create Outputs**: Generate 5 samples from original and improved prompts.
